Favorite culture that I am not native to is China.  I like that Chinese culture and history go back so far in time.
China is such a vast country with different landscapes, all very beautiful, and I'd love to visit one day.
Vincent van Gogh for his creativity even when he struggled daily and Brene Brown for her contributions to social work and encouraging
others to be their authentic selves.
A meal that represents me is grilled pineapple.
I feel most creative when it's raining.
